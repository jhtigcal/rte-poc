# Welcome to my cave

Today, we are evaluating six rich text editor packages. We will be taking a look at their upsides, downsides, and how they fare overall in our ever-growing ecosystem.

Here are the editors we will be evaluating:

- [CK Editor](/ck-editor)
- [TinyMCE](/tiny-mce)
- [Froala](/froala)
- [Tiptap](/tiptap)
- [Lexical](/lexical)
- [Slate](/slate)

We will be looking at the following criteria for each editor:

- **Ease of installation:** How easy is it to install the most basic version of the editor.
- **Ease of use:** How easy is it to add features?
- **Pricing:** How much does it cost to use the editor?
- **Styling and customization:** To what extent can the editor be styled and customized?
- **Documentation:** How good is the documentation?

We will also be looking into trying to mold the rich text editors as close to the following components as possible:

<DemoEditor />

The motivation behind this is to see how easy it is to integrate these editors into a React project with existing UI library and how well they can be styled and customized to fit our needs, giving us a rough estimate of how much work it would take to integrate them into our existing projects. This project uses the following tech stack for front end development:

- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Radix UI

We've also provided support for light mode and dark mode for this project, to simulate how the editors adjust to theming.

# Summary

We have evaluated six rich text editors, three of which are "headless" and three are out of the box WYSIWYG editors. The headless editors are:

- Tiptap
- Lexical
- Slate

The out of the box editors are:

- TinyMCE
- Froala
- CK Editor

## Installation

All of the editors were relatively easy to install, and were relatively easy to integrate into the project. A few of the editors required a bit of extra configuration to get them to work, but nothing too difficult.
