## Overview

### Installation

- Install the `froala-editor` package.
- Comes with a fully functional rich text editor react component.
- Import the css file to the rich text editor.

### Ease of use

- Uses a single class to create and customize the editor.
- You have to register commands and plugins to the editor in order to customize it.
- A bit similar to the way we customize `SurveyCreator` in SurveyJS (war flashbacks).
- This feels like a brute force way of customizing the editor, which is not ideal for our use case since we have SurveyJS for that.

### Pricing

- Has a free trial period.
- Pay $899/year for professional use
- Pay $1999/year for enterprise use
- If you're interested, they're running a 20% discount if you manage to purchase by Friday (02/23/2024) midnight.

### Styling and customization

- Supports theming.
- Like most out-of-the-box fully fledge rich text editors, it's a bit difficult to customize the look and feel of the editor.

### Documentation

- The documentation is good, but not great.
- A lot of people hate it on Reddit.

### Pros

- Fully fledge rich text editor.
- Comes with a lot of features out of the box.
- Has a lot of plugins and commands to customize the editor.

### Cons

- Expensive.
- Not easy to customize and style.
- Not the best documentation.
- Some of the features, we might not even use.

### Personal notes

- I don't think this is the right tool for us.
- TinyMCE is a better alternative, if we're going for out-of-the-box fully fledge editors.
- TinyMCE even offers a way to migrate your editor from Froala to TinyMCE.
