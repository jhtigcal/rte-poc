# CK Editor

## Installation

**Pre-built Editors**

The installation process for CKEditor was relatively easy. The documentation was clear and concise, and the editor was easy to integrate into the project. We can select a build from the editor (there are five different builds to choose from) and install it via a package manager.

1. Go to the [CKEditor website](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/download/) and choose an editor build.
1. Install the editor using your package manager.

**Custom build Editors**

The custom build process was a bit more complicated than the pre-built one.

1. Go to the [CKEditor website](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) and choose the features you want to include in your build.
1. You will be provided a zip file with the editor build.
1. Extract the zip file to your project directory (i.e. `YOUR_PROJECT_DIR/ckeditor5`) and include it in the package.json file as a dependency.

```json
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
    "ckeditor5-custom-build": "file:./ckeditor5"
  }
}
```

After the installation process, we can use the editor in our project.

```tsx
// @/components/ck-editor.tsx

import { CKEditor } from "@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react";
import * as CKEditor5CustomBuild from "ckeditor5-custom-build";

function CustomEditor(props: { initialData?: string }) {
  return (
    <CKEditor
      editor={CKEditor5CustomBuild.default.Editor}
      data={props.initialData}
    />
  );
}

export default CustomEditor;
```

## Pricing

CK Editor 5 is free to use &mdash; it is open source under the GPL License &mdash; but it also offers a commercial license with additional features. The paid version is called CKEditor 5 Collaboration. The free version is more than enough for most use cases, but if you need additional features, you can consider the paid version.

## Ease of use

The editor is easy to use and has a lot of features. It is easy to integrate into a project and has a clear and concise documentation. The editor is also easy to customize and has a lot of plugins available.

## Demo

We can only use one type of editor in this demo, but we can use multiple editors in a real project.
