## Overview

### Installation

- Create an account with TinyMCE [here](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/).
- Upon signing up, you will be provided with an API key, which is required to use the TinyMCE editor.
- Install the `@tinymce/tinymce-react` package.
- Use the `Editor` component provided by the `@tinymce/tinymce-react` package to render the editor and add the API key to it.

### Ease of use

- The TinyMCE editor is easy to use and provides a lot of functionality out of the box.
- Can be used in three modes: inline, classic, and distraction-free.
- Works seamlessly with React and provides a lot of configuration options.
- Editor functions are not extracted, so it is not possible to use only a few functions from the editor.

### Pricing

- Core is free.
- Essentials ($67/month), Professional ($130/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing) are paid plans.

### Styling and customization

- The TinyMCE editor can be styled and customized to a great extent.
- Allows use of skins. Skins can be created manually or using the TinyMCE skin tool.
- Icon packs can be used to change the icons used in the editor.
- Toolbar can also be customized, but not extracted.

### Documentation

- The TinyMCE documentation is extensive and provides a lot of examples.
- The support is also probably dedicated and extensive as well, if we're going to pay for it.

### Pros

### Personal notes

- Easy to use and integrate
- Might be impossible to customize buttons/separate toolbar/create custom events
- You wouldn't really customize the functionality because it all works seamlessly
- They thought of everything, but they're opinionated on the design of components
- Does everything, functionality-wise, but lacks a bit in design
