# TinyMCE

TinyMCE is a platform-independent web-based JavaScript HTML WYSIWYG editor control released as open-source software.

## Installation

- This package requires an account with TinyMCE, which can be created [here](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/). I signed up using my Github account, and it was a very straightforward process.
- Upon signing up, you will be provided with an API key, which is required to use the TinyMCE editor. The API key is used to authenticate the editor and to track usage. The API key is passed to the editor using the `apiKey` prop.
- The installation is relatively straightforward and can be easily accomplished by following the getting started guide.

```tsx
import { Editor } from "@tinymce/tinymce-react";

export function TinyMceEditor() {
  return (
    <Editor
      apiKey="your-api-key-here"
      init={{
        plugins:
          "anchor autolink charmap codesample emoticons image link lists media searchreplace table visualblocks wordcount checklist mediaembed casechange export formatpainter pageembed linkchecker a11ychecker tinymcespellchecker permanentpen powerpaste advtable advcode editimage advtemplate mentions tinycomments tableofcontents footnotes mergetags autocorrect typography inlinecss",
        toolbar:
          "undo redo | blocks fontfamily fontsize | bold italic underline strikethrough | link image media table mergetags | addcomment showcomments | spellcheckdialog a11ycheck typography | align lineheight | checklist numlist bullist indent outdent | emoticons charmap | removeformat",
        tinycomments_mode: "embedded",
        tinycomments_author: "Author name",
        mergetags_list: [
          { value: "First.Name", title: "First Name" },
          { value: "Email", title: "Email" },
        ],
      }}
      tagName="textarea"
      initialValue="Welcome to TinyMCE!"
    />
  );
}
```

This is all the code required to get the TinyMCE editor up and running. The `Editor` component is provided by the `@tinymce/tinymce-react` package, and the `init` prop is used to configure the editor. The `init` prop is an object that contains the configuration options for the editor. The `apiKey` prop is used to authenticate the editor.

## Customization

We shall evaluate the customization options available for the TinyMCE editor in two categories: styling and theming, and functionality.

### Styling and Theming

Out of the box, the TinyMCE editor does not provide the developer with a lot of options for styling and theming. The editor is styled using the default styles provided by the TinyMCE package. The editor does not provide a lot of options for customizing the look and feel of the editor.

This makes it hard/impossible to integrate into our existing Survey Builder application, which requires a lot of customization to match the look and feel of the rest of the application.

### Functionality

The TinyMCE editor provides a lot of functionality out of the box. The editor comes with a lot of plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of the editor. The editor also provides a lot of configuration options that can be used to customize the behavior of the editor.
