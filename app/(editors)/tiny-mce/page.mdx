# TinyMCE

TinyMCE is a platform-independent web-based JavaScript HTML WYSIWYG editor control released as open-source software.

## Installation

- This package requires an account with TinyMCE, which can be created [here](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/). I signed up using my Github account, and it was a very straightforward process.
- Upon signing up, you will be provided with an API key, which is required to use the TinyMCE editor. The API key is used to authenticate the editor and to track usage. The API key is passed to the editor using the `apiKey` prop.
- The installation is relatively straightforward and can be easily accomplished by following the getting started guide.

```tsx
import { Editor } from "@tinymce/tinymce-react";

export function TinyMceEditor() {
  return (
    <Editor
      apiKey="your-api-key-here"
      init={{
        plugins:

        ],
      }}
