## Overview

### Installation

- Install packages.
- Import and use editor from package.
- Add necessary plugins

### Ease of use

- A bit more complex than Tiptap and other out-of-the-box editors.
- But, it's more flexible and customizable.
- Exports as react components.
- Plugins are also react components, which means they can be lazy-loaded.
- Opinionated when it comes to Editor tree structure.

### Pricing

- Free and open-source.
- Yep, it's free. Now put your wallet back in your pocket.

### Styling and customization

- They only provide the editable content area. Everything else should be made by you.
- We can separate/combine functionalities however we want.
- Plugins are highly flexible.
- Has own life cycle, but you can easily subscribe to it.
- Editor commands are dispatch calls (redux-like).

### Documentation

- Good documentation.
- Has solid user base.
- Active development.
- If you find yourself stuck, you can always brute force yourself since the package is made for React.

### Pros

- Highly flexible and customizable.
- Made for React by Meta engineers.
- Good documentation.
- It's free and open-source.
- Editor commands are dispatch calls and can be used in other parts of the application (as long as you have access to the editor instance).

### Cons

- A bit of a learning curve.
- Not as easy to use as Tiptap.
- Doesn't provide support (it's free and open-source, so it's understandable).

### Personal notes

- I like the flexibility and the fact that it's made for React.
- It's a bit more verbose than Tiptap, but it's more flexible and customizable.
- I think this one and Tiptap provide are the most balanced in terms of flexibility and ease of use.
