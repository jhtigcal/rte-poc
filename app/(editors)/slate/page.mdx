# Slate

Slate is a completely customizable framework for building rich text editors. It is built on top of the `ContentEditable` API and is designed to be highly customizable. It is also designed to be highly extensible, so you can add your own custom plugins to it.

## Installation

To install Slate, you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm add --save slate slate-react
```

## Demo

Here is a simple example of how you can use Slate to build a rich text editor:

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

import { Descendant, createEditor } from "slate";
import { Slate, Editable, withReact } from "slate-react";

const initialValue: Descendant[] = [
  {
    type: "paragraph",
    children: [{ text: "A line of text in a paragraph." }],
  },
];

const Editor = () => {
  const [editor] = React.useState(() => withReact(createEditor()));
  return (
    <Slate editor={editor} initialValue={initialValue}>
      <Editable />
    </Slate>
  );
};

export { Editor as SlateEditor };
```

<SlateEditor />
